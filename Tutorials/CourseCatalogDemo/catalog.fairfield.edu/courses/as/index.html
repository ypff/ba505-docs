<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">Popular entertainments have great power. &quot;They tell us what is on the minds of ordinary people at any given moment - their concerns, biases and anxieties - and in turn refine them and restate them in a palatable, easily understood way,&quot; wrote Professor Emeritus Brooks McNamara of New York University of this new field of scholarly inquiry that plumbs America's popular entertainments as a means of understanding its social history. This course will examine critical live entertainment forms that flourished in the years between the conclusion of the Civil War and the end of the 1920s largely due to increased leisure time, improved transportation, and rapidly developing cities. Popular entertainment -- amusements aimed at a broad, relatively unsophisticated audience -- were frequently American reinventions of European imports, such as the circus, while others, like the Minstrel Show, were uniquely American creations. We will begin the course with an intensive look at the Minstrel Show as a key to the solidification and perpetuation of American racist stereotypes and then consider Circus, the Wild West Show, Vaudeville, Burlesque, Medicine Show, Chautauqua, and popular dramas such as Toby, Tab, and Tom shows, as manifestations of American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">The frontier -- traditionally understood as the place where &quot;humanity&quot; comes into contact with its apparent absence in the shape of alien beings and landscapes -- has been the subject of some of the most lasting powerful stories in the formation of U.S. national identity. The purpose of this course is to investigate the ideological underpinnings of this myth and its consequences, as well as to explore alternative conceptulizations of the frontier, particularly as a &quot;rhizomatic&quot; space where cultures meet and grapple with one another.

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASAH 0441 Fine Art vs. Anti-Art: 1917 to 1967</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">Dr. Wayne Craven writes in American Art: History and Culture, &quot;As the new century opened America was a nation in transition, and ripe for many kinds of revolutions - in politics, social systems, and certainly in literature and painting. [These] social shifting values and forces were occurring within American society at large.&quot; Focusing on the 50 years from WWI to Vietnam, this class examines the artistic debates and ideological struggles manifested by American art. During this time, there is a shifting barometric needle of stylistic expression. On one side, we see an entrenched, traditionalist school that retains the noble beaux arts criteria for realism and classical content. Artists to be studied in this school are: Henri, Sloan, Hopper, Marsh, Cadmus, Benton, Curry, Wood, Sheeler, Demuth and Wyeth. On the other side of the aesthetic spectrum, we encounter rebels leading the avant-garde. Sparked by the new &quot;isms&quot; of European modernism, artists to be discussed include: Duchamp, Stella, Dove, O'Keeffe, Gorky, Pollock, Rothko, Frankenthaler, De Kooning, Motherwell. The culmination and convergence of these parallel tracks arrive with the neo-realist but equally avant-gardist Pop art movement of the 1960s. Warhol, Rosenquist, Johns, and Wessleman use hard-edge realism to convey anti-establishment parodies and camp spin-offs of high culture. The period between 1917-1967 becomes, then, the pivotal shift when traditionalism is converted into a new cultural paradigm ending modernism as a distinct period.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASHI 0415 Inventing Themselves: African-American Women in U.S. History</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">At the intersection of race, gender, and class, African-American women often challenged the codification of blackness and femaleness as well as a limited conception of class consciousness. From the diaspora to the present, they created forms of resistance, devised survival strategies, and transmitted cultural knowledge while defying racial/gender stereotypes. The multiple roles assumed by African-American women during their struggle from slaves to citizens in the United States represent a complex study of the relational nature of difference and identity. This course focuses on African-American women as subjects and agents of pivotal importance within the family, community, and labor force.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASHI 0439 The Tumultuous 20th Century: Key Issues in United States Political and Social History</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">The United States in the 20th Century has seen massive strikes, social upheaval, political challenge, and unparalleled prosperity and growth. This intensive reading, writing, and discussion seminar examines key issues and figures in the political and social changes of the 20th century - from Progressivism to Bill Clinton, from the first Red Scare and the rise of the American Civil Liberties Union to current struggles over political and civil rights in the context of the War on Terror.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASHI 0442 Immigration, Ethnicity, and Race in United States History</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">This intensive reading, writing, and discussion seminar examines the history of U.S. immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. Arranged thematically within a chronological framework, the seminar situates the United States within the context of global migration patterns and economic development. The first part of the course investigates patterns of migration and community settlement, family strategies of survival and adaptation, and immigrant cultures. The second part analyzes the reception of successive immigrant groups. Most importantly, the course explores how race, ethnicity, assimilation, acculturation, and Americanization were defined by American government and society. Throughout, the course conducts a critical evaluation of how historians and other scholars have studied immigration and immigrant communities and examines today's perceptions of the American immigrant experience. Varied readings include monographs, oral histories, reform investigations, and a novel.</p>

<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">This seminar will teach students various aspects of researching and constructing a historical geographical study, using one community's land records, tax records, genealogical records, and maritime records. The course will include lab work, training in computer techniques, including geographic information science (GIS) technology, which will provide students with a usable skill that is applicable to many professional careers. The case study will change each time the course is offered. Most recently, it was &quot;Little Liberia,&quot; an early Free Black community in the South End of Bridgeport in the 1820s and 1830s and the site of the Freeman Houses, built in 1848 and listed in the National Historic Register.</p>

</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">This seminar explores crises and turning points in U.S. Foreign Relations from the American Revolution to 9/11, the Iraq War, Afghanistan and up to the present, including the Alliance with France, the War of 1812, Manifest Destiny, the Mexican War, Indian Removal, the Spanish-American-Cuban-Filipino War, World War I, Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and the resurgence of China and Russia.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASIT 0481 Visions of Italy and America in Film</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">Adaptations and critiques of genres and themes indicate cinematic health. Italian cinema, which has given rise to movements such as neorealism, commedia all'italiana, and the spaghetti western, has provided the original material for adaptations by directors from other countries, notably the United States. The prevalence of American adaptations is a measure of the artistic contribution of the Italian national cinema. In this course we examine the phenomenon of adaptation and interpretation of Italian films from the postwar period until today. After a condensed review of more than 60 years of Italian cinematic history, we examine several American interpretations of Italian film classics. Garnett's The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), based upon James Cain's novel, revisits Visconti's Ossessione (1943). Neil Simon's Sweet Charity (1966) and later Woody Allen's Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) re-tell Fellini's tragic tale of Le notti di Cabiria (1957). More subtle parallels are found in Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty (2000) and Fellini's Lo sciecco bianco (1956). Brian DePalma's Blow Out (1981), starring John Travolta, maintains the premise of Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966). Madonna and Guy Ritchie's 2002 remake of Swept Away (1974), as well as Garry Marshall's adaptation Overboard (1987), reveal the impact of Wertmuller's original. These American reflections on Italian films, themselves dark mirrors reflecting on the themes and assumptions of American film hegemony, offer another means to appreciate the powerful insights of self-reflection in the Italian postwar period.</p>
</div><div class="courseblock">
<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASIT 0493 Italian-American Experience</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">Students analyze the concept of nationality and national identity in literature, film, and critical essays by and about Italian-Americans and discuss the concept of race and racial origins together with the phenomenon of emigration. The course addresses role and represen-tation differences for men and women in this subgroup of American society, with particular consideration given to the ethnic roots of these differences. It also examines the ways in which poetry, prose, and film reveal Italian ethnicity in 19th- and 20th-century America, with special emphasis on the sense of otherness that this immigrant group experienced.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASRS 0442 Jews and Judaism in America</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">What has it meant in the past and what does it mean today to be a Jew in America? Viewing Judaism and Jewishness as inseparable from one another, Jews remain a distinct, though by no means homogeneous, religious and ethnic group in American society. This course explores the religious, cultural, social, economic, and political diversity that exists among American Jews, as well as distinctive beliefs, concerns, and experiences that continue to unite them. The course pays special attention to issues related to immigration, acculturation, gender, and African-American/Jewish relations.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASSO 0412 Contemporary American Society</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">This course analyzes the dominant ideology and values that have shaped American culture - namely, the Protestant ethic - and how and why these values are changing. The course also analyzes major institutional trends that have transformed and continue to transform America and the modern world - bureaucratization, industrialization, urbanization, the rise of the business corporation, science, and technology - and the effects of these institutions in producing new personality types, mass society, and rapid social change. The course provides a macro-sociological framework.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASSO 0465 Urban Sociology: New York</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">This course examines the evolution of the city in the American experience by focusing on New York City. Both New York's unique history and contemporary social structure are examined. Readings and classroom discussion are combined with three field trips to New York on three successive Saturdays. Each field trip explores an area of New York.</p>
</div><div class="courseblock">
<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASSO 0469 Women: Work and Sport</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">Gender stratification exists in most areas of everyday life throughout American society. This course concentrates on the varying experiences (based on class, race, and ethnic differences) of women in the workplace and on the playing field. Sex segregation and sex integration as complex historical and contemporary processes constitute the main focus of the first part of the course. Within this context, economic and social changes will be viewed as historically having an enormous impact on the roles of women in the work force and how they have managed these roles. In turn, their experiences will be analyzed as catalysts of societal change. The last part of the course focuses on women as athletes. Their varied experiences in this world parallel to a large extent their experiences within the workplace. The underlying theme is that the sports arena mirrors the larger society particularly in terms of gender roles. What is seen as &quot;acceptable and non-acceptable&quot; behavior for women in the everyday world is reflected in their roles as athletes. The impact of gender on socializing children into sport and sport itself as a socializing agency is the foundation for critically assessing the outcomes of Title IX and the existence of homophobia in sport.</p>

<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASTA 0420 American Drama and Society</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">This course explores the social, political, and economic forces that have shaped the United States via the themes and perspectives expressed in its drama. The course covers the late 18th century through the present, paying particular attention to dramas and more populist forms of entertainment that specifically address the notion and development of a distinctly American voice and ideology. Students begin with Royall Tyler's 1787 comedy, The Contrast, which offers the first wholly American character - Jonathan the &quot;true-blue&quot; Yankee - and end with Tony Kushner's monumental two-part drama, Angels in America (1991), which juxtaposes American Judaism and Mormonism within the context of politics, homo- and heterosexual relationships, and the AIDS epidemic. In between, students consider the work of seminal American dramatists (O'Neill, Miller, Williams, and others) as well as trends in popular theatre forms (minstrelsy, wild west shows, vaudeville, burlesque, musical comedy) in creating the totality of the American cultural experience.</p>
</div><div class="courseblock">
<p class="courseblocktitle noindent"><strong>ASTA 0421 Ethnic American Performance and Society</strong><span class="credits">3 Credits</span>
</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">The course will explore the social, political, economic, and cultural forces that have shaped the United States via the themes, perspectives, and production choices expressed in its ethnic drama and performance. We will consider plays and performance pieces (such as pow-wows, Chinese New Year celebrations, and the like) created by African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latino/a Americans, and Native Americans, all of whom have been marginalized voices existing outside of mainstream theatre, an arena historically dominated by white males. We shall pay particular attention to issues of race, gender, and class apparent in both the play texts as well as in the ideological perspectives of the playwrights. We also will note the choice of subjects, themes, and environments and consider how these are placed within the larger context of American culture and society.</p>
