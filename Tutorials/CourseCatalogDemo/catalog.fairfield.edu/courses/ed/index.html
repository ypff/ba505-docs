A range of philosophical perspectives will be explored including Jesuit Education/Ignatian Pedagogy, Deweyan Progressive education, and Freirian Critical Pedagogy.

</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">In accordance with the professional standards for teaching mathematics, this course emphasizes the important decisions a teacher makes in teaching: setting goals, selecting or creating a variety of appropriate mathematical tasks, supporting classroom discourse; integrating mathematics across the curriculum; assessing student learning; and creating a supportive classroom environment. During this course, candidates explore the relevance of theory in the classroom. In addition, candidates investigate the development of specific concepts such as computation and geometry in elementary age children. Candidates engage in adult-level mathematics activities designed to increase an understanding of mathematics, examine the latest research on how children learn mathematics, and explore strategies for dealing with diverse learners. Additionally, as socially responsible educators, candidates examine how mathematical practices and teaching methods are influenced by underlying theoretical principles linked to history and the position of the classroom teacher. Course requirements include on-site fieldwork in an elementary school for a minimum of two hours per week during the semester.</p>

Drawing on the works of liberatory educators, such as Paulo Freire and Maxine Greene, as well as the arts and popular culture, this course provides the basis for dialogue on the transformative power of our imagination.

Connecting theory, practice and personal experience in useful and imaginative ways, we will, in the words of Maxine Greene, begin to see: schooling as it could be otherwise; teaching as it could be otherwise; learning as it could be otherwise; culture as it could be otherwise; the world as it could be otherwise.</p>

Continued professional development is stressed, including development of a professional portfolio, continued study and research, and establishing a supportive collegial network. Under the guidance of university supervision, teacher candidates assume full teaching responsibilities, including curriculum and lesson planning anchored in the principles of multicultural education and social responsibility, differentiated instruction, and effective organization and management, while carrying out other faculty duties, including participation in school governance and professional development. As educators for social justice and social responsibility, they engage in related school and community-based activities with students, families, and community members. Enrollment requires state-approved waiver of student teaching; performance-based assessment, including but not limited to successful completion of at least 27 prerequisite certification track credits and related course requirements while a matriculated candidate in the Elementary Education MA program, and permission of the Elementary Education program director.</p>

Consult with advisor for information) Candidates are expected to develop authentic educational products, with the expectation that candidate-generated products will become contributions to the candidate's specialty area (i.e., English Education, Social Studies Education, etc). The process for this product will be supported in a 10-hour writing seminar course that, with substantial independent work, would be supervised by faculty editorial and revision input toward the development of worthy professional products.
