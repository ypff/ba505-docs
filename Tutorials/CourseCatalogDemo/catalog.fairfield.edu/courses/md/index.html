</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">While the explosion of both online educational resources and digital content creation tools has opened up a new world of possibilities for classroom teachers, few instructors have the time to do the exploration and collation necessary to truly take advantage of all the Internet has to offer. In this hands-on course, each student will be given the opportunity to assume the role of digital content developer for an actual university course: working closely with an instructor to define and research course content, learning how to evaluate digital tools for presenting material across devices and platforms, and choosing the best options -- be they aggregators, e-book creators, online portfolios, or other web tools -- to produce, collate, and deliver the content required by the professor. The materials produced will subsequently be used in actual Fairfield University courses. This course is open only to students enrolled in the Educational Technology program.</p>

</p>
<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">The term &quot;literacy&quot; used to be associated with the ability to read and write. How we interact with our environment is evolving as technology evolves. This has resulted in an expansion of the definition of literacy. Literacy now includes several facets: Information, Media, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It is important for students to understand the 21st century literacies and be able to use them as a guide in the global community that helped create the need for them. This course explores the concept of 21st century literacy and how these skills can be both taught to students and integrated into our teaching to support student learning.</p>

<p class="courseblockdesc noindent">Technologies are being introduced at an astounding pace, and their adoption is increasingly being driven by consumers rather than by institutional needs and considerations. For educational technology managers, the ability to critically assess new tools and foresee where technology is heading are essential skills. In this course, students will examine the introduction of a variety of mass communication and digital technologies in the recent past in order to develop an understanding of the common elements that have characterized technical innovation in U.S. society and their potential use in education. In taking a case-study approach to the topic, students will conduct research on the relative success of, and societal/institutional reactions to, the various technologies. Students will also study failed technologies in an effort to understand what elements might have been missing. The course will culminate with each student developing their own measurement and assessment of a current &quot;new&quot; technology and develop a strategic plan as to how it might be pursued/implemented in their own school or district. This course is only open to students enrolled in the Sixth Year Certificate program in Educational Technology.</p>
