As case studies from the global north and south illustrate, states are increasingly turning to global and domestic disciplinary regimes to wall up, fence out, surveillance, detain and deport the &quot;other.&quot; Students examine these trends in the context of the moral, political, security, corporeal and human rights questions at stake.
